<div class='code-section'><button class='copy-prompt-button' onclick='copyPrompt()'>Copy Prompt</button><pre><code id='prompt-code'>Your response should be formatted as HTML paragraphsThe following is a system of interacting proteins. Write a critical analysis of this system, describing your reasoning as you go.
What mechanisms and biological processes are performed by this system?
What cellular components and complexes are involved in this system?
Proteins: CHST9, DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, RASD2, TK2.


A critical goal of the analysis is to determine what, if any, relationship this system has to ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)
Here are some ASD-related facts about these proteins
Genes with high confidence mutation in ASD-diagnosed individuals: LRP5, LRP6
Genes in systems with 2 or more known ASD-risk genes: CHST9, DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, RASD2, TK2
ASD-risk genes identified in Satterstrom et al., 2020: 
ASD-risk genes identified in Fu et al., 2022: 
Proteins connected to ASD-risk proteins (AP-MS experiment): 
ASD-risk in SFARI categories 2 and 3:
