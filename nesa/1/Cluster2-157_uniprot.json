New vessels are prone to leakage and rupture causing exudates and bleeding, followed by scarring, retinal detachment and blindness. Clinical features can be highly variable, even within the same family. Patients with mild forms of the disease are asymptomatic, and their only disease related abnormality is an arc of avascular retina in the extreme temporal periphery. In many ways the disease resembles retinopathy of prematurity but there is no evidence of prematurity or small birth weight in the patient history.",
