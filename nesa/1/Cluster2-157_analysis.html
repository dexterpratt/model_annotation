    <h2>Gene candidacy information</h2>
    <p>Genes with high confidence mutations in ASD-diagnosed individuals: LRP5, LRP6</p>
    <p>Genes in systems with 2 or more known ASD-risk genes: CHST9, DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, RASD2, TK2</p>

    <h2>ChatGPT 4 Analysis</h2>

    <p>The interacting protein system being analyzed consists of six proteins: CHST9, DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, RASD2, and TK2. These proteins are involved in various mechanisms and biological processes, with a significant emphasis on the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cell differentiation. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway includes three of the proteins: DKK1, LRP5, and LRP6. This pathway is crucial for the regulation of gene expression and cellular functions.</p>
    <p>Regarding cellular components and complexes, the system's proteins are located in various cellular regions. Four of the proteins (CHST9, LRP5, LRP6, and RASD2) are found in the membrane, with DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, and RASD2 being present in the plasma membrane. CHST9, DKK1, and LRP6 are located in the extracellular region, while LRP5 and LRP6 are found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, DKK1 and LRP6 are present in the early endosome membrane. The Wnt-Frizzled-LRP5/6 complex involves LRP5 and LRP6, which participate in the coreceptor activity for both canonical Wnt signaling and the Wnt signaling pathway.</p>
    <p>With regards to ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), LRP5 and LRP6 are genes with high-confidence mutations in ASD-diagnosed individuals. All six proteins (CHST9, DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, RASD2, and TK2) are part of systems with two or more known ASD-risk genes. However, specific ASD-risk genes identified in the Satterstrom et al., 2020, and Fu et al., 2022 studies were not provided, and information on proteins connected to ASD-risk proteins (AP-MS experiment) and ASD-risk in SFARI categories 2 and 3 is also missing.</p>
    <p>From the Uniprot analysis, three proteins (LRP5, LRP6, and TK2) have disease variant associations. LRP6 and RASD2 are associated with synapses, which are crucial for neural communication and may play a role in ASD pathophysiology. Moreover, LRP5 and LRP6 are involved in the regulation of various transcription factors and processes, which may influence the expression of genes linked to ASD.</p>
    <p>In summary, this interacting protein system appears to be predominantly involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, with an emphasis on the canonical Wnt signaling. The presence of high-confidence ASD-associated mutations in LRP5 and LRP6, along with the system's overall connection to ASD-risk genes, suggests that further investigation into the role of these proteins and their relationship with ASD is warranted.</p>


    <p>As mentioned earlier, LRP5 and LRP6 are the genes with high-confidence mutations in ASD-diagnosed individuals in this system. To determine whether they can be considered as potential novel ASD-risk genes, we need to verify whether they are included in known ASD-risk gene sets, such as SFARI. Unfortunately, the provided information does not mention their inclusion or exclusion from such gene sets. Assuming that they are not included in any known ASD-risk gene sets, we can analyze their potential as novel ASD-risk genes based on their associations and functions.</p>
    <p>LRP5: This gene is involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for the regulation of gene expression and cellular functions. It is a membrane protein found in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. LRP5 also participates in the Wnt-Frizzled-LRP5/6 complex and is involved in the regulation of various transcription factors and processes. Although there is no direct evidence of LRP5's association with diseases comorbid with ASD, its involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is known to play a role in brain development and function, could imply a potential connection to ASD.</p>
    <p>LRP6: Like LRP5, LRP6 is also involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and has a similar cellular distribution. It is associated with synapses, which are crucial for neural communication. Dysfunctions at the synapse level have been implicated in ASD. LRP6's association with synapses and the Wnt signaling pathway could potentially link it to ASD. However, there is no specific information about LRP6's association with diseases comorbid with ASD.</p>
    <p>In summary, assuming LRP5 and LRP6 are not included in known ASD-risk gene sets, they can be considered as potential novel ASD-risk genes based on their involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, cellular distribution, and, in the case of LRP6, its association with synapses.</p>
