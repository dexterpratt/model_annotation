You are assisting a molecular biologist in the analysis of a system of interacting proteins 

A critical goal of the analysis is to determine what, if any, relationship this system has to ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)
First, write a critical analysis of this system, describing your reasoning as you go.    
What mechanisms and biological processes are performed by this system?    
What cellular components and complexes are involved in this system?    
Second, analyze the proteins to discuss which of them might be the product of novel ASD-risk genes    
Third, discuss potential names for the system. Select the best name and place it in a paragraph     at the beginning of your output
Save any summary analysis of the system to the last paragraph.                 
Avoid overly general statements of how the proteins are involved in various cellular processes
                
Avoid recapitualting the goals of the analysis. 
                
Your response should be formatted as HTML paragraphs
