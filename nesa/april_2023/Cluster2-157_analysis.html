    <h2>ChatGPT 4 Analysis</h2>
    <h2>ASD-Related Wnt Signaling and Synaptic Regulation System</h2>
    <h3>Mechanisms and Biological Processes</h3>
    <p>Based on the Uniprot analysis, the most prominent biological processes performed by this system include the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, involving DKK1, LRP5, and LRP6, and synaptic regulation, involving LRP6 and RASD2. The Wnt signaling pathway is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The involvement of LRP5 and LRP6 in coreceptor activity, Wnt receptor activity, and Wnt-protein binding highlights their essential roles in this pathway. RASD2, on the other hand, is a GTPase involved in signaling processes and has been implicated in synapse formation and function.</p>
    <h3>Cellular Components and Complexes</h3>
    <p>Several cellular components and complexes are involved in this system. For instance, DKK1, LRP5, and LRP6 are all associated with plasma membrane and are essential for Wnt signaling. LRP5 and LRP6 are both part of the Wnt signalosome and the Wnt-Frizzled-LRP5/6 complex. Moreover, CHST9 and DKK1 are secreted proteins, while LRP6 and RASD2 have roles at the cell membrane and synapse.</p>
    <h3>Potential Novel ASD-Risk Genes</h3>
    <p>Considering the system's involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway and synaptic regulation, LRP5, LRP6, and RASD2 could potentially be the products of novel ASD-risk genes. LRP5 and LRP6, as core components of the Wnt signaling pathway, may contribute to ASD through their involvement in neuronal development and synapse formation. RASD2, being involved in synapse formation and function, is also a strong candidate for a novel ASD-risk gene.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, the ASD-Related Wnt Signaling and Synaptic Regulation System comprises proteins with significant roles in the Wnt signaling pathway and synaptic regulation, including DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, and RASD2. LRP5, LRP6, and RASD2 show the most potential as novel ASD-risk genes due to their crucial roles in these processes. Further research into the interactions and functions of these proteins may provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ASD.</p>
