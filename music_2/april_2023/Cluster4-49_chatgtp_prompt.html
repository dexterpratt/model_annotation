Write a critical analysis of this system, describing your reasoning as you go.
What mechanisms and biological processes are performed by this system?
What cellular components and complexes are involved in this system?
Proteins: NCBP1, STMN1, STMN3, TBC1D2.


A critical goal of the analysis is to determine what, if any, relationship this system has to cancer, and specifically to osteosarcoma

System features from a Uniprot analysis: 
cytoplasm: 4 proteins: NCBP1, STMN1, STMN3, TBC1D2
cytosol: 4 proteins: NCBP1, STMN1, STMN3, TBC1D2
nucleoplasm: 2 proteins: NCBP1, TBC1D2
neuron projection: 2 proteins: STMN1, STMN3
tubulin binding: 2 proteins: STMN1, STMN3
microtubule depolymerization: 2 proteins: STMN1, STMN3
neuron projection development: 2 proteins: STMN1, STMN3
regulation of microtubule polymerization or depolymerization: 2 proteins: STMN1, STMN3
