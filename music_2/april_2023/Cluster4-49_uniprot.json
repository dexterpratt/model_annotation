            "Component of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), a heterodimer composed of NCBP1/CBP80 and NCBP2/CBP20 that interacts with m7GpppG-capped RNA. Found in a U snRNA export complex containing PHAX/RNUXA, NCBP1/CBP80, NCBP2/CBP20, RAN, XPO1 and m7G-capped RNA. Identified in a IGF2BP1-dependent mRNP granule complex containing untranslated mRNAs. Interacts with PHAX/RNUXA, SRRT/ARS2, EIF4G2, IGF2BP1, HNRNPF, HNRNPH1, KIAA0427/CTIF, PARN, DROSHA, UPF1 and ALYREF/THOC4. May interact with EIF4G1; the interaction is however controversial since it is reported by PubMed:11340157, PubMed:15059963 and PubMed:15361857, but is not observed by PubMed:19648179. The large PER complex involved in the repression of transcriptional termination is composed of at least PER2, CDK9, DDX5, DHX9, NCBP1/CBP80 and POLR2A. Component of an alternative nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) composed of NCBP1/CBP80 and NCBP3 (PubMed:26382858). Interacts with METTL3 (PubMed:27117702). Interacts with ZFC3H1 in a RNase-insensitive manner (PubMed:27871484). Interacts with MTREX (PubMed:30842217). Interacts with TASOR (By similarity). Interacts with DHX34; the interaction is RNA-dependent (PubMed:25220460)"
